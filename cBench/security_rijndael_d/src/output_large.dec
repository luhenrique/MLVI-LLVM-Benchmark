Kurt Vonnegut's$Û²‘mencement Address at MIT

  r5Bies and gentlemen of the cla“(Ğjf '97: 

  Wear sunscreen. 
mƒhìf I could offer you only oneÊ ‰ for the future, sunscreen wL2G8 be it. The
  long-term beneµöb of sunscreen have been prov/Öç“y scientists, whereas the
  Ç^ô of my advice has no bsis moİ¤í´eliable than my own meanderiB¡¼Ä experience. I will dispense4Ìaùs advice now.

  Enjoy the p¯ÇØÈ and beauty of your youth. Oåé6Ëever mind. You will not
  unK£&,tand the power and beauty ofL>&Ir youth until they've faded.…;P trust
  me, in 20 years, yoĞÔ look back at photos of your¯:<| and recall in a way
  you cQKÊ grasp now how much possibilyAüülay before you and how fabul'Aûˆyou
  really looked. You arecàÇ: as fat as you imagine.

  D
ÈÍ2 worry about the future. Or ‘ÒÊ y, but know that worrying ism47  effective as trying to solµˆŞÑn algera equation by chewingÃøble gum. The
  real troublesAU(vyour life are apt to be thin›÷2hat never crossed your
  worÚç- mind, the kind that blindsiÆ•¢ou at 4 pm on some idle TuesI^

  Do one thing every day th¶'scares you. 

  Sing. 

  Doúé\kbe reckless with other peopl9·ºÅhearts. Don't put up with peÊ|Ìr who
  are reckless with youg2Í"
  Floss. 

  Don't waste yogG°?ime on jealousy. Sometimes yFF*Ùe ahead, sometimes you're
  ø6²€nd. The race is long and, in+øQ” end, it's only with yourselá™çÇ  Remember compliments you rïD/óve. Forget the insults. If yó'h\ucceed in
  doing this, tellÆÙßhow.

  Keep your old love l‡Ë’rs. Throw away your old bank7æÃtemnts. 

  Stretch. 

  Don¬Ğüeel guilty if you don't knowúş¥t you want to do with your läĞî™ The
  most interesting peop5¾ò/ know didn't know at 22 whatÈÁØHy wanted to do with
  their 2	Us. Some of the most interestŒİqy40-year-olds I know still došåI

  Get plenty of calcium. Bxß«Ünd to your knees. You'll misç%em when they're
  gone.

  Mø½º you'll marry, maybe you won‹‘ƒIMaybe you'll have children, gşQèe you
  won't. Maybe you'll ùOb5rce at 40, maybe you'll danczvã„e funky chicken on
  your 75[dMJedding anniversary. WhateverTn)4 do, don't congratulate yourè8º
  too much, or berate yoursZeither. Your choices are hal~Á’ance. So are
  everybody els|Ô>

  Enjoy your body. Use it jE· y way you can. Don't be afra/1f it or of what
  other peop	EÆ hink of it. It's the greatesf–strment you'll ever own.

  |™e, even if you have nowhere Ğ§™o it but your living room. 
#®¡ead the directions, even if nñ$idon't follow them. 

  Do noyGà$ad beauty magazines. They wif5nly make you feel ugly. 

  DˆÓvto know your parents. You ne90-‘know when they'll be gone fo¬Wå
od. Be
  nice to your siblin/ìò^They're your best link to yoƒ\!üast and the people
  most li3nÔ to stick with you in the fuHô.

  Understand that friendsçŸQ'e and go, but with a preciouiıów you should hold
  on. Work
«fd to bridge the gaps in geog¼ê\y and lifestyle, because the^‘völder you get, the more you n¢Ğthe people whoi who knew you¿½gkn you were
  young.

  Live n{{ew York City once, but leave%‡lÅore it makes you hard. Live h¹£© Northern California once, b‚äç¯eave before it makes you sofWìravel.

  Accept certain inaŒ5Ûvable truths: Prices will ris­Ñ}„oliticians will
  philander.åbœS, too, will get old. And whe»«Òu do, you'll fantasize that
ä‰
¬en you were young, prices we¼ÍWŒeasonable, politicians were Û±ye, and
  children respected ïÿ€r elders.

  Respect your elL&. 

  Don't expect anyone elÕ\Go support you. Maybe you havß˜ŞÎtrust fund. Maybe
  you'll h]NäŸa wealthy spouse. But you ne•—w#know when either one might rIè<[ out.

  Don't mess too muchï[h your hair or by the time y]¬še 40 it will look 85. 

  Bep)¾ful whose advice you buy, bu°]»Î patient with those who suppÑÀ½Ã it. Advice is a form of nos:û[ia. Dispensing it is a way o~Ã]Gshing the
  past from the di19al, wiping it off, painting x
t the ugly parts and
  recycl‚!¸it for more than it's worth.Ù~LÛBut trst me on the sunscreenáù³
